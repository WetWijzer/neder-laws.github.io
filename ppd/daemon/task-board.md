# PP&D Daemon Task Board

Status: active
Last supervisor tranche: 2026-05-15

## Worker Rules

- Work one unchecked task per daemon cycle, in order from top to bottom.
- Preserve completed tasks and append new work instead of rewriting history.
- Keep every proposal narrow and deterministic.
- Do not implement live DevHub login, CAPTCHA, MFA, account creation, payment, submission, certification, cancellation, official upload, or inspection scheduling.
- Use committed synthetic fixtures before any live or authenticated automation.
- Do not create private DevHub session files, auth state, traces, HAR files, screenshots, raw crawl output, downloaded documents, or local private document artifacts.
- For every changed Python file, include `python3 -m py_compile ` in validation or rely on `python3 ppd/tests/validate_ppd.py` when it covers the file.
- For every changed TypeScript file, include strict `tsc --noEmit` validation when TypeScript exists.
- After recent syntax preflight failures, prefer one core file plus one narrow fixture/test per task instead of broad multi-contract rewrites.

- [x] Task supervisor-20260514-028: Add validation that archive manifests reject raw body persistence, private/authenticated DevHub URLs, missing processor metadata, missing source IDs, and invented hashes for skipped captures.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260514-029: Add a normalized HTML extraction fixture for one synthetic PP&D guidance page with title, breadcrumbs, headings, ordered steps, warnings, tables, contacts, related links, update dates, and citation spans preserved in source order.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260514-030: Add a normalized PDF/form extraction fixture for synthetic public form metadata covering page anchors, checklist items, fillable field names, signature/certification blocks, file-preparation instructions, and OCR confidence flags without storing PDF binaries.

- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-035: Add a source-freshness readiness fixture that blocks guardrail readiness when official source evidence is stale, missing, or hash-changed; use synthetic registry/change-monitor records only, and keep the change to one helper/test pair plus one fixture if needed.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-036: Add deterministic requirement formalization readiness validation proving only fresh, supported, human-reviewed requirement nodes can feed a guardrail bundle; do not add broad new contracts or live source reads.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-037: Add a process-model coverage fixture for permit paths that PP&D guidance says are unsupported by DevHub or require manual/email handling, and validate that next-safe-action output becomes manual handoff rather than DevHub automation.

- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-054: Add validation that the agent bundle loader rejects uncited process stages, unsupported actions without manual-handoff outcomes, guardrail predicates without evidence IDs, and next-safe-action explanations without citation spans.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-055: Add a redacted synthetic user case store adapter that accepts fixture case facts and document metadata, normalizes fact freshness/confidence, and rejects credentials, payment details, auth state, screenshots, traces, HAR data, raw private values, and local private paths.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-056: Add a deterministic case-to-process gap report that combines the user case store, process bundle, document compliance, source freshness, and citation integrity outputs to return only missing, stale, ambiguous, or conflicting prompts plus safe next actions; use fixtures only.

- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-059: Add an attended DevHub capture readiness manifest validator that requires manual login handoff, attendance, redaction policy, accessible-structure-only capture scope, and exact-confirmation boundary notices while rejecting session state, cookies, credentials, screenshots, traces, HAR data, uploads, submissions, scheduling, and payment actions.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-060: Add an agent-facing action decision API fixture that classifies read-only review, reversible draft, save-for-later, manual handoff, refused consequential action, and financial boundary outcomes with cited explanations and required confirmations; do not automate browser actions.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-061: Add a fixture-first crawl promotion audit that joins source registry records, discovery decisions, dry-run crawl plans, robots/preflight status, processor capability choice, rate-limit bucket, and metadata-only output policy before any public fetch can be considered eligible; use synthetic fixtures only.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-062: Add validation that crawl promotion remains blocked when robots or policy preflight is unknown, rate-limit policy is missing, freshness policy is stale, host expansion is over-broad, or any output path would persist raw bodies or downloaded documents.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-063: Add an injectable fake public-capture transport fixture that turns approved synthetic crawl intentions into ArchiveManifest-style metadata records with redirect chains, HTTP status, MIME type, content hash, processor metadata, and `no_raw_body_persisted`; do not make network requests.
- [x] Task supervisor-20260515-064: Add validation for the fake public-capture transport that rejects private/authenticated URLs, missing source IDs, missing processor metadata, invented hashes for skipped captures, raw body fields, downloaded PDF paths, and local private paths.
